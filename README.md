Personal Pokedex

A project using AJAX calls to the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co) to load Pokemon data, store, and display it.
Also uses CSS filters, music, and placeholder images for long load times.

Design based on the original Game Boy Pokemon games, using Pokemon fonts from [dafont](http://www.dafont.com) converted to woff files, with a cameo appearance from Sean Connery's character from the 70'sci fi movie "Zardoz."
